As a tech enthusiast and a lover of coding, I recently participated in the **Proxy 22** hackathon, a 48-hour national hackathon that brought together some of the brightest minds in the country. The hackathon was designed to test our skills in different areas of programming and problem-solving, and I must say, it was a truly enriching experience.

The hackathon had three rounds of competition. The first round was the game-making round, where we had to use the **Pygame** library to create a platformer game similar to Super Mario or Flappy Bird. Despite putting in our best effort, we did not win any prize in this round, but the feedback from the judges helped us improve our game-making skills.

The second round was the treasure hunt round, where we had to find different solutions and tasks by running over the college campus. It was a thrilling experience, and we had to solve puzzles in different languages like **LOLCODE, Brainfuck**, and many more. We managed to secure the second position in this round, which was a great motivation for us.

The final round was the CTF (Capture the Flag) round, which was the most challenging and stressful of all the rounds. In this round, we had to find the flag by hacking into different websites and files. It was a real test of our coding and problem-solving skills, and we put everything we had into this round. We managed to come in second place, which was a great achievement for us.

Overall, we managed to secure the second position in the Proxy 22 hackathon, which was a great achievement for our team. Participating in a hackathon can be a great way to test your skills, meet new people, and learn new things. The **Proxy 22** hackathon was an amazing experience, and I learned a lot from it. I got to meet other tech enthusiasts and exchange ideas and knowledge with them. Although we did not win the top prize in every round, our performance in the treasure hunt and CTF rounds helped us secure the second position overall. I am grateful for this opportunity and can't wait to participate in more hackathons in the future.
