**Aug 20, 2023 - Embarking on the Chess App Journey**

Today marks the beginning of an exciting journey — building my very own chess app from scratch! Armed with a vision of creating an intuitive and engaging platform for chess enthusiasts, I dove into the world of coding and game development. After setting up my development environment and gathering resources, I started working on the initial layout of the chessboard. My plans for the project is to build my project something like Chess.com also I will be including multiplayer in future

**Aug 21, 2023 - Chessboard Visuals and Piece Representation**

Progress is being made as I focused on creating a visually appealing chessboard. I learned how to represent each piece using images and how to position them correctly on the board. It's both challenging and rewarding to see the pieces come to life and line up in their initial positions. The excitement is building!

**Aug 22, 2023 - User Interaction and Piece Movement**

Today was all about enabling user interaction with the chess pieces. Implementing click events to select and move pieces felt like a major achievement. With each piece now responding to my clicks, I'm beginning to see the mechanics of the game take shape. Next stop, implementing legal move validation!

**Aug 23, 2023 - Legal Move Validation and Piece Logic**

It's been a day of refining the game's logic. I tackled the intricate task of validating legal moves for each piece type. The challenge lies in considering factors like piece type, special moves (like castling and en passant), and the overall game state. It's humbling to realize the complexity behind every chess move.

**Aug 24, 2023 - Implementing Moves and User Feedback**

Today was all about bringing the chess moves to life. With legal move validation in place, I worked on updating the board after each move. The feeling of successfully moving a piece, seeing the updated position, and getting instant feedback brought a sense of accomplishment. The app is truly starting to resemble a playable chess game!

**Aug 25, 2023 - Highlighting Legal Moves and UI Polish**

Enhancing the user experience has been the focus of today. I implemented a feature that highlights legal moves when a piece is selected, giving players a clear view of their options. Additionally, I spent time polishing the user interface, adjusting colors, and optimizing responsiveness. It's amazing to see the transformation!

**Aug 26, 2023 - Days of Playtesting and Debugging**

As the chess app takes shape, I spent today playtesting and identifying potential bugs and glitches. It's a crucial step to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for future users. Debugging, fine-tuning, and making small improvements have been my main tasks. Every issue resolved brings me closer to a more refined app.

**Aug 28, 2023 - Introducing Opponent AI**

A major milestone was reached today — I introduced AI for an opponent! Implementing a basic AI that can make random legal moves adds a whole new dimension to the game. It's fascinating to see the AI opponent strategize and interact with the player. The feeling of playing against my own creation is surreal.

**Oct 04, 2023 - Implemented Sockets**

It's been one month the game has gone through major changes. I used socket.io to implement multiplayer functionality. It was a challenging task to implement sockets but it was worth it. Now the game is playable with friends and family. Now the players can randomly join and starts playing as Guest.
